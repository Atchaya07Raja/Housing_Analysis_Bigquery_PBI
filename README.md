## ‚úÖ Insights Derived

- Zealand and Jutland show highest overall sales values.
- Older properties are more expensive on average.
- Offer prices align closely with purchase prices, indicating stable pricing.
- Farmhouses have the highest price per square meter.
- Apartments and Villas offer the most favorable mortgage yields.
- YOY Sales declined slightly in most sale types, except family sales which saw growth.

## üîç Conclusion

This project demonstrates how powerful insights can be generated by integrating **BigQuery for scalable SQL-based data preprocessing** and **Power BI for interactive reporting**. From cleaning millions of records to visualizing regional and categorical trends, the workflow covers the complete data analytics pipeline.

Using BigQuery allowed efficient aggregation and transformation of large datasets, which were then visualized in Power BI with calculated metrics and slicers for flexible analysis. The project highlights patterns in house pricing, regional performance, and sale types ‚Äî helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
